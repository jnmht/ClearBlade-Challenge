# ClearBlade-Challenge
The Code Does the following 2 Tasks-
1. Write a code service in the ClearBlade platform to store the above message into a Collection. The code service needs to trigger for every publish (after the data is published).
2. Write another code service that performs some interesting analytics (of your choice) on the data stored in the above collection & publish the analytics results on an MQTT topic called 'analytics'. Run this service at regular intervals.

The Python SDK is there in the Jupyter Notebook, and the Micro Service for the ClearBlade Platform is stored in the .txt files. You just need to copy the code into the Micro services with the name of the code kept same as the name of the file you copied.
